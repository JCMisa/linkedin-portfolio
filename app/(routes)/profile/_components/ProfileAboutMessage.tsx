      <div className="mt-5 w-full text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        My journey in tech began with a passion for building things that matter.
        I&apos;ve had the opportunity to develop responsive web and mobile
        applications for clients, achieving a 90% client retention rate by
        utilizing Next.js, React Native, and .NET frameworks. I enjoy
        architecting solutions from the ground up, whether it&apos;s optimizing
        database schemas with tools like MySQL and PostgreSQL or developing
        robust RESTful APIs with .NET Web API and FastAPI with Modal to ensure
        seamless service integration.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also have a background in data analytics and simple bookkeeping, using
        tools like Python, Pandas, and Excel to deliver actionable insights that
        have increased client decision-making efficiency by 40%. My skills also
        extend to virtual assistance, where I&apos;ve crafted designs with
        Canva, managed social media, and edited videos and podcasts to boost
        engagement and quality. I&apos;m also a fast learner, always eager to
        explore new technologies, from CMS platforms like WordPress to
        e-commerce solutions like Shopify.
        <br />
        <br />
        I&apos;m constantly working on new projects that showcase my skills,
        like TechTrail, an AI-powered learning management system, Zeno, a
        real-time code editor, and Odeon, a web application that help users
        craft music powered by AI. I&apos;ve also earned multiple certifications
        in areas such as AWS, Project Management, and Business Analytics.
        <br />
        <br />
        I&apos;m always looking for opportunities to learn and collaborate on
        innovative projects. Feel free to connect with me on{" "}
